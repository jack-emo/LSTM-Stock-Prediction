# Welcome to LSTM-Stock-Prediction

This Python Script is my implementation of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks to predict a given stock price based on previous stock ticker data

### Built with
* math
* matplotlib
* pandas
* numpy
* keras
* sklearn

### Features
* Analyzes any given stock (set to Facebook right now) (provided with .csv file) based on close data
* Creates a plot which shows actual performance of stock in comparison to the LSTM Prediction
* Will include interactivity to change the analysis to be based on opening value, as well as any stock based on user input (coming soon)

### Usage
~/stock_analyze python3 stock_analyze.py

### Example
(Date represents the days since the .csv collected the data for the stock, Close Price represents the closing price in USD)
